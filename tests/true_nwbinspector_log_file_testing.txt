===================

CRITICAL IMPORTANCE
-------------------
1.0.1   TimeSeries 'test_time_series_3' located in '/acquisition/'
        check_timestamps_match_first_dimension: The length of the first dimension of data does not match the length of timestamps.
1.0.2   SpatialSeries 'my_spatial_series' located in '/processing/behavior/Position/'
        check_data_orientation: Data may be in the wrong orientation. Time should be in the first dimension, and is usually the longest dimension. Here, another dimension is longer. 

BEST PRACTICE VIOLATION
-----------------------
1.1.1   TimeSeries 'test_time_series_1' located in '/acquisition/'
        check_dataset_compression: Consider enabling compression when writing a large dataset.
1.1.2   TimeSeries 'test_time_series_2' located in '/acquisition/'
        check_regular_timestamps: TimeSeries appears to have a constant sampling rate. Consider specifying starting_time=1.2 and rate=2.0 instead of timestamps.
1.1.3   TimeSeries 'test_time_series_2' located in '/acquisition/'
        check_dataset_compression: Consider enabling compression when writing a large dataset.
1.1.4   TimeSeries 'test_time_series_3' located in '/acquisition/'
        check_dataset_compression: Consider enabling compression when writing a large dataset.
1.1.5   SpatialSeries 'my_spatial_series' located in '/processing/behavior/Position/'
        check_dataset_compression: Consider enabling compression when writing a large dataset.
