Installation
============

This guide assumes the user is familiar with the goals and structure of the NWB standard (# TODO, link to nwb entrypoint)

The NWBInspector tool offers convenient command-line usage via any standard Conda or Python terminal. (# TODO, add note for people coming from MatNWB and link to installation of conda)

To install the package in any generic Python v3.7-v3.9 environment, simply type

```
pip install nwbinspector
```

.. note::

    If the standard Python Package Index (PyPI, where `pip` installs from) is not working for you, it
    should also be possible to install from conda-forge via
    
    ```
    conda install nwbinspector
    ```
