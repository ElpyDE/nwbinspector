Loading the Check Registry
--------------------------

For importing, the first thing you always want to import is the base registry of checks...

```bash
from nwbinspector import available_checks
```

This registry is a list of predefined and automatically imported functions.
Every check function is designed to run on a certain core data type in an NWBFile we will refer to as the `neurodata_type`.
